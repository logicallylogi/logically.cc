# Typing Test
```For when you and the other programmer in your history class place a $20 bet on who can type the fastest```

## Planned Features
- "Purely Random" mode (absolute gibberish, TRUE typing speed)
- "Lorem" mode (kind-of gibberish)
- "Word" mode (literally re-typing a book)
- 1/2/5/10 minute mode to get a "true" average
- Compares scores from your device
