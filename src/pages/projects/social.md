# LogicallySocial
```For when your friends care about their privacy while they tell the internet every thought they think```

## Planned Features
- Encrypted private stories
- PGP-focused data transfer
- Posts self-destruct after 1 year
- Basically secure Twitter

Note: I do plan to add some form of decentralization, but I can't promise anything on how it'll work or if it'll support ActivityPub
